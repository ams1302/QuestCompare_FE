API Details

Amazonâ€™s IGDB API provides access to a rich database of video game information, including titles, genres, platforms, and more. This API is essential for powering the search, discovery, and comparison features within the application.

MongoDB Atlas was chosen for its ease of use and efficient cloud-based management, enabling focus on application development rather than database maintenance.
